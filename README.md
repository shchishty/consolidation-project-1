## Game Rules

- The game is played with one player.

- This game does not reveal the position letter (example being that the letter "h" starts or ends or is in the middle of the word).
- The program tracks how many letter guesses and how many word guesses the player makes.
- A playerâ€™s final score is the number of turns (letter guesses) they made before guessing the correct.
